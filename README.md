# RED's Student Showcase Project - andresnavas.ca

### Description:
Utilize all the materials during the course to create a personal website for Andres Navas, A UX student, based on his design. I decide to use Wordpress CMS so he can manage his project easily.

I have presented this project at the RED's student showcase on December 10, 2015.

* Home page displays his projects with option to hide one or many of them.
* Sticky navigation bar
* Dynamically skill bar
* Most of the contents is dynamic and can be changed easily using Wordpress Dashboard


### Stuff used to make this:

* HTML/CSS
* Wordpress CMS
* JQuery and JQuery plugins: 
* Custom Post Type, Custom Field Suite (a lot!!!!)
* SASS
* Gulp Task Runner
* Dploy to upload changes to live site
* Responsive Web Design

##### My thought on the project :+1: :

It was a great experience working with Andres. The whole process feels like a real work environment where I received design comps from the UX designer and worked my way through the project.

As the design is simple, I want to give Andres the best experience on Wordpress dashboard. He can customize almost every content, every photos from his site. He can choose to display the projects he likes on the home page. I was able to achieve this by using a lot of custom field suite and its loop. It was challenging and fun at the same time.

It was also interesting working with the sticky navigation bar, especially on the home page.
